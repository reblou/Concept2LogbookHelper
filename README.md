# Concept 2 Logbook Helper

Logbook helper is a React/ ASP.NET Core Web API web app designed to integrate with your Concept 2 workout history and present it in a more useful way.

It allows you to filter and sort workouts by date, workout type, time, distance, pace, SPM, calories and heart rate. Making it easy to compare past performance across similar workouts.

Workout details are accessed via the Concept 2 API, using OAuth2 authentication to access Concept 2 account details

## Why 

I made this project because of wanting features that were missing in the official C2 app and website, and to learn more about front end development/ React in particular. 

## Access

This project is still in development and there is no public URL as of yet.
